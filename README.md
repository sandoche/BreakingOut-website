# BreakingOut-website
ðŸ‘® A Prison Break themed multiplayer persistent online browser game



## Disclaimer

I built this game around the age of 16, back in 2007, the code quality is very very bad. 

Please do not judge me for that and use it as your own risks ðŸ˜¬ ðŸ˜‚

I decided as a memory to share it online and to leave it open source under MIT Licence.
